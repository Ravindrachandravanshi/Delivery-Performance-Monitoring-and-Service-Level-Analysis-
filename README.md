# Delivery-Performance-Monitoring-and-Service-Level-Analysis-
A data-driven dashboard to track and improve On-Time and In-Full delivery performance for key customers. This dashboard was developed to address service issues impacting contract renewals, as AtliQ Mart expands into Tier 1 cities.

Objective: Developed a robust dashboard to track and improve ‘On-Time’ and ‘In-Full’ delivery performance for key customers, addressing service issues that led to non-renewal of annual contracts. The goal was to ensure timely and complete deliveries as prepares for expansion to Tier 1 cities.

Key Responsibilities:
Designed and implemented metrics for daily tracking of service levels, including On-Time Delivery (OT %), In-Full Delivery (IF %), and On-Time In-Full Delivery (OTIF %), aligned with customer-specific targets.

Outcome: 

•	Total Orders sales not matched with target by 31%.

•	In full orders only achieve 56% but our target was 76.5%.

•	OTIF only get 29.36% and target is 65.91%.

•	June is the most problematic month all OT%, IF% and OTIF% decreased at lower level.

•	We are still not having any improvement in Ontime but IF and OTIF is getting better in last two months.
